# SenScope
Overview:
The SentimentSense project is an innovative application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify social media feedback, specifically Twitter comments. The project aims to determine the sentiment of user feedback by categorizing it into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. 

This classification provides valuable insights for businesses, organizations, and individuals to gauge public opinion and improve their services or products.
